# CS280_test4_multicore
 since test 4 takes a while this is code to run it multicore for faster turnarounnd time

test4 should take 0.25 per test 3 and there are 1000 test3 so that will take just over 4 minutes, with this you can devide that time by the number of logical processors that your computer has

note: this is for the rummikub assignment

TODO: have python.
change line 12 to have 1 less than the number of cores that you have
change line 14 to be the command to run your

this will out put how much time it takes total as, and will not stop if things are solved incorrectly, nor will it handle correctly infinate loops.

PS: this has only been tested on linux so there might be some issues when using this on windows, but if people are able to get it to work on windows (and it needs some changes), please message me on teams or discord (Green_7#1335)
